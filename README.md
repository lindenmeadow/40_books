This is a Rails app that is based on the 40 Book Challenge, created by author Donalyn Miller. The format used here is an adaptation of the 40 Book Challenge used by my wife, who is an elementary school teacher, and some of her colleagues. 

Users -- probably elmentary school students -- will be able to sign up, using their email address as a user name and creating a password. The app enables users to create a reading log, which will consist of individual reviews of books in specified genres. The 'about' page includes instructions as to what books are acceptable and how many book reviews in each genre are to be created. Users are only able to view, edit, and delete book reviews that they create themselves. 

Note: The Gemfile calls for Ruby 2.7.2. If using a different version of Ruby, you will need to update the Gemfile to reflect this.
