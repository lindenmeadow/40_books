This is a Rails app that is based on the 40 Book Challenge, created by author Donalyn Miller. The format used here is an adaptation of the 40 Book Challenge used by my wife, who is an elementary school teacher, and some of her colleagues. This is a work in progress that I will be updating over the coming weeks. 

Note: The Gemfile calls for Ruby 2.7.2. If using a different version of Ruby, you will need to update the Gemfile to reflect this.
